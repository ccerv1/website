My name is Carl Cervone. I'm passionate about using data to improve governance and public goods funding.

I recently launched a new startup called [Kariba Labs](https://www.karibalabs.co/). Our first product is an analytics platform called [Open Source Observer](https://www.opensource.observer), which helps foundations and ecosystem funds allocate funding to open source projects. 

Most of my recent writing has been about Open Source Observer and the need for better funding infrastructure for digital public goods. I also write about data visualization, coffee, travel, and random stuff like mini art projects or a bracket to find the best pizza in NYC.

Previously, I worked at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai) building [hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org), a set of open source protocols for funding and rewarding impact. I was also the Cofounder & COO of [Enveritas](https://enveritas.org), a technology-based platform for verifying the sustainability of coffee & cocoa companies. We monitored supply chains for issues like deforestation, labor practices, and price transparency using a mix of satellite imagery and on-the-ground field surveys in 20+ countries.

I'm a [Gitcoin steward](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program), board member of [Cup of Excellence](https://cupofexcellence.org/), a contributor to several DAOs, including [DreamDAO](https://www.dreamdao.xyz/) and [Orange](https://www.orangedao.xyz/) (the YC alumni DAO), and a Vice President at my local PTA. 

I took a pretty atypical path to where I am today. Back in college, I spent my first two years on a Computer Science track before switching to Environmental Science. I did a minor in a field called Science & Society (a blend of philosophy of science and economics). My [thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253841943_Estimating_Soil_Loss_Using_ASTER_and_Diffuse_Reflectance_Spectrometry_a_Case_Study_of_the_Village_of_Kambi_ya_Simba_in_Northern_Tanzania's_Rift_Valley_Highlands) used remote sensing and soil spectrometry to predict erosion in a Tanzanian village. I raised some grants to go back to Tanzania after graduation, which became what I fondly call my "DIY Peace Corps" experience. I learned Swahili and started a microfinance program in the same village. After that, I worked at an international development organization called [TechnoServe](https://www.technoserve.org/). I started out as a volunteer helping coffee cooperatives build accounting and inventory management systems. I then played a key role in securing and implementing a [$65 million grant from the Gates Foundation](https://www.technoserve.org/our-work/projects/coffee-initiative/), and setting-up a large crossfunctional team in Ethiopia. We helped over 100 cooperatives get [new financing](https://pressroom.ifc.org/all/pages/PressDetail.aspx?ID=22203), and produce wonderful specialty coffees. I went on to be a founding member of their Strategic Initiatives team in New York, leading partnerships and consulting engagements with a portfolio of coffee companies. I also completed an MBA at Columbia during this time.

I live in Brooklyn with my wife and two young boys. In the winter, I enjoy skiing in the Catskills and the rest of the year I love having friends over for pizza on the Ooni.
