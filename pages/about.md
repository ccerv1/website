My name is Carl Cervone.

I'm a Startup Operator at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai), helping build [hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org). Hypercerts are a set of open-source protocols for funding and rewarding positive impact.

I enjoy writing short essays on a variety of subjects. Some are just for fun. Some are instructional. Recently, I've been writing mostly about funding mechanisms that can help address problems like climate change and governance of digital commons. I also write about data visualization, coffee, travel, and random stuff like mini art projects or a bracket to find the best pizza in NYC.

Previously, I was the Cofounder & COO of [Enveritas](https://enveritas.org), a technology-based platform for verifying the sustainability of coffee & cocoa companies. We monitor supply chains for issues like deforestation, labor practices, and price transparency. It's a pretty amazing process: first, we use satellite imagery & machine learning to identify farms; then, we send local field teams to interview farmers & workers and make observations about agronomic & environmental conditions. All this data helps companies achieve their responsible sourcing commitments and design more impactful farmer support programs. To date, we've visited more than 200,000 farms in 25 countries.

I'm also on [Gitcoin's stewards council](https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-the-community-stewards-program), a board member of [Cup of Excellence](https://cupofexcellence.org/), and a contributor to several DAOs, including [DreamDAO](https://www.dreamdao.xyz/) and [Orange](https://www.orangedao.xyz/) (the YC alumni DAO). 

Before Enveritas, I worked at [TechnoServe](https://www.technoserve.org/) in a variety of roles. I started out as a volunteer helping coffee cooperatives in Tanzania build accounting and inventory management systems. I then played a key role in securing and implementing a [$65 million grant from the Gates Foundation](https://www.technoserve.org/our-work/projects/coffee-initiative/), and setting-up a 100+ person crossfunctional team in Ethiopia. We helped over 100 cooperatives with financing and marketing, including a [landmark deal with the IFC](https://pressroom.ifc.org/all/pages/PressDetail.aspx?ID=22203), and produce wonderful specialty coffees. Finally, I joined as a founding member of TechnoServe's Strategic Initiatives team in New York, leading partnerships and consulting engagements with a portfolio of coffee companies. I also completed an MBA at Columbia during this time.

Back in college, I spent my first two years on a Computer Science track before switching to Environmental Science. I also did a minor in a field called Science & Society (a blend of philosophy of science and economics). My [thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253841943_Estimating_Soil_Loss_Using_ASTER_and_Diffuse_Reflectance_Spectrometry_a_Case_Study_of_the_Village_of_Kambi_ya_Simba_in_Northern_Tanzania's_Rift_Valley_Highlands) used remote sensing and soil spectrometry to predict erosion in a Tanzanian village. I raised some grants to go back to Tanzania after graduation, which became what I fondly call my "DIY Peace Corps" experience. I worked for about two years doing agroforestry & microfinance programs in the same village I did my thesis research in. 

I live in Brooklyn with my wife and two young boys. In the winter, I enjoy skiing in the Catskills and the rest of the year I love having friends over for pizza on the Ooni.
