_A short manifesto in response to the FTX debacle, crossposted on [Supermodular](https://community.supermodular.xyz/t/lets-10x-the-greenpill-community-in-2023/141)_.

Humans created money to coordinate better<br>
Old money has no values programmed into it<br>
Old money manifests the values of the people who control it<br>
But it doesn’t explicitly state what those values are or who they are intended to best serve<br>
Nor does it require that the people who control the money have the authority to do so granted to them from the free consent of the people who use the money
<br><br>
Until recently, only nation states possessed the power to issue money<br>
Crypto enables anyone to issue new forms of money<br>
This new money, however, requires the issuer to set explicit, immutable constraints<br>
You can program both laws and values into this new form of money<br>
And you can use this new money to mobilize & coordinate people who share those values<br>


This is a profound difference, worth restating

As humans, we have - and will likely always have - an unbounded set of coordination problems<br>
Up to now, we’ve had only a single money system to deploy on all such problems<br>
Now, we have an unbounded set of money possibilities<br>
Now, we have the power to better calibrate the properties of the money we use to the problem we face<br>


Here’s an analogy:

Until the late 19th century, bloodletting was viewed as the remedy for the majority of illnesses<br>
The field of modern medicine was enabled from the realization not just that bloodletting was ineffective but also that specific health maladies require specific diagnoses, prescriptions and procedures<br>

As a civilization-scale breakthrough, programmable money may be more like the discovery of fire than modern medicine<br>
The power of fire was immediately apparent to all humans<br>
Fire is uncontainable: once someone knows how to capture fire, they cannot be stopped… as long as they are not behind bars<br>

It took millennia for fire to enable foundational technology improvements<br>
If only warriors were interested in fire, we might get guns but not steam engines
If only engineers were interested in fire, we might get steam engines but not pizza
If only Italians were interested in fire, we might get pizza but not penicillin

If only bankers and autocrats are interested in crypto, what will we get?

To increase the possibility of crypto being a net good for the world, there need to be as many clusters of people with different backgrounds, motivations, and use cases building with it

We are optimistic that in the long run the uses cases that will have the greatest adoption will be the ones that have the greatest positive benefits for the greatest number of people

Critically, this is a bet not on technology, but on humankind
If you are willing to take that bet, then how do you engineer the highest probability of success?

Unfortunately, no one individual or group can engineer it
Such an endeavor is as futile as trying to create a “Council for the Responsible Use of Fire”<br>
This is a global collective intelligence problem, not a central intelligence problem

The greenpill movement is an invitation to people of all stripes to imagine and build with crypto

It is an urgent movement because a positive-sum future is by no means guaranteed<br>
It is a movement that is under existential threat from people using this technology solely for short-term gain and from blanket regulations attempting to stifle the worst types of behavior<br>

Greenpillers need to speedrun the ponzis and myopic forms of regulation<br>
Greenpillers have no right to expect they will inherit a better world<br>
Greenpillers must work with renewed urgency to build a better world.
